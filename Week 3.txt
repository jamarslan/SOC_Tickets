###  Objective 

Focus on  incident escalation ,  alert triage , and  advanced threat detection  using  SIEM correlation rules to detect complex attack patterns.

---

###  Task Description 

1.  Review MITRE ATT&CK Techniques 

   * Research  two new techniques :

     *  Privilege Escalation  (e.g., Sudo Caching, Exploiting Trusted Relationships).
     *  Exfiltration  (e.g., Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel).
   * Create a  MITRE ATT\&CK mapping  for both techniques.

2.  Advanced SIEM Rule Creation & Correlation 

   * Use your SIEM tool to create  two advanced correlation rules :

     * One rule for  Privilege Escalation  (e.g., exploitation of sudo or trusted relationships).
     * One rule for  Exfiltration  (e.g., data exfiltration over C2).
   * For each rule, specify the  log sources ,  conditions , and  expected alerts 
   * Simulate these events using  Security Onion  or similar pcap files.
   * Test the rules using  sample logs  (you can use  open-source logs  or  Security Onion  if needed).

3.  Incident Escalation Workflow 

   * Review the  escalation process  and  reporting formats  used in SOC.
   * Based on your  SIEM alert findings , create an  incident escalation template  that would be used for reporting to senior analysts or IR teams.
   * Practice  escalating an incident  based on your SIEM findings and include the necessary details (e.g., evidence, impact, system involved).

4.  Traffic Analysis & Correlation 

   * Use  Wireshark  or another traffic analysis tool to capture  advanced suspicious activity .
   * Identify signs of  privilege escalation  or  data exfiltration  (such as abnormal shell activity or large data transfers over unusual ports).
   * Take  screenshots of your findings  from your analysis.

5.  Documentation & Reporting 

   * Write a  2-page report  combining:

     * MITRE ATT\&CK mappings (Privilege Escalation & Exfiltration).
     * SIEM rules with detailed explanations.
     * Traffic analysis findings and correlation with attack techniques.
     * Incident escalation template and recommended actions.

---

###  Tools & Resources Allowed 

*  SIEM tools : Splunk, Wazuh, Elastic, Security Onion (or any other preferred SIEM tool).
*  Traffic Analysis : Wireshark, Security Onion, or other traffic capture tools.
*  Resources : MITRE ATT\&CK Framework, open-source logs, public pcap repositories.

---

###  Deliverables 

*  MITRE Layer PDF  with Privilege Escalation & Exfiltration techniques mapped.
*  2 Advanced Detection Rules  for SIEM (Privilege Escalation and Exfiltration).
*  Screenshots  of traffic analysis findings.
*  Incident Escalation Template .
*  2-page report  combining:

  * MITRE mappings.
  * Rule explanations.
  * Traffic analysis findings.

---

###  Submission Method 

* Submit all files in a  zipped folder  named:
  `SOC-WK3-[YourName].zip`
* Upload via the internship folder or email.

---

###  Evaluation Criteria 

* Correctly mapped MITRE ATT\&CK techniques.
* Effective and correctly implemented SIEM correlation rules.
* Accurate traffic analysis and correlation with attack techniques.
* Clarity and completeness of report and incident escalation template.
* Timely submission.

---

 Mentor Notes: 

* Focus on  creating rules that are actionable  and testable in real-world environments.
* Understand how to correlate  multiple logs/events  to catch more complex attack patterns.
* Practice using real  escalation templates  to communicate effectively with senior teams.
