SOC Internship – Week 1 Task Ticket
Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK1-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote
Assigned Date: 11-Aug-2025
Due Date: 17-Aug-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective
Learn SOC workflow, map attack techniques in MITRE ATT&CK, and perform basic packet analysis using Wireshark — including analyzing a pre-captured malicious pcap to simulate an incident investigation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task Description
1. SOC Workflow & MITRE ATT&CK
- Research the SOC alert lifecycle (Alert → Investigation → Incident → Escalation → Closure).
- Open MITRE ATT&CK Navigator (https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/enterprise/).
- Highlight at least three techniques:
	- Brute Force
	- Phishing
	- Command and Control (C2)
- Save your layer and export it as PDF.

2. Wireshark Fundamentals
- Install Wireshark (latest version).
- Capture your own network traffic and identify:
	- A TCP 3-way handshake.
	- A DNS query and corresponding response.
	- An HTTP GET or POST request (with request headers).
- Save the capture as .pcap.

3. Mini Challenge – Malicious Traffic Analysis
- Download the provided file:
	malicious_traffic_week1.pcap (example from a safe, public training dataset).
- Open in Wireshark and identify:
	- Suspicious DNS queries (possible malware domains).
	- Outbound connections to unusual IPs.
	- Any sign of a file download or C2 beaconing.
- Take screenshots of at least 3 suspicious events.
4. Documentation
- Combine findings from your own capture and the malicious pcap into a 1–2 page PDF report.
- Include:
	- Observations from normal vs malicious traffic.
	- Why these events matter in SOC investigations.
	- How they map to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools & Resources Allowed
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
- Wireshark
- Provided malicious pcap (safe training data)
- Internet for protocol/indicator research
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deliverables
- MITRE Layer PDF with highlighted techniques.
- Screenshots:
	- At least 3 from your own capture.
	- At least 3 from the malicious pcap.
- PCAP files (your capture + malicious).
- 1–2 page PDF report with:
	- Findings.
	- MITRE mapping.
	- Short SOC relevance explanation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submission Method
- Zip all files into:
	SOC-WK1-[YourName].zip
- Submit via internship shared folder or email.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluation Criteria
- Correct identification of events.
- Accurate MITRE mapping.
- Clear and concise documentation.
- Ability to distinguish normal vs malicious patterns.
- On-time submission.
