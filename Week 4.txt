SOC Internship – Week 4 Task Ticket

Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK4-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote
Assigned Date: 01-Sep-2025
Due Date: 07-Sep-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)
--------------------------------------------
Objective

Simulate a real SOC analyst workflow by monitoring alerts, correlating multiple log sources, escalating incidents, and creating professional incident response documentation.
------------------------------------------
Task Description

1. SOC Monitoring Simulation

Use Security Onion / Wazuh / Splunk / ELK to monitor logs from multiple sources:

Firewall

Proxy

Authentication servers

Endpoint logs (Sysmon or Windows Event Logs)

Identify alerts that may be related or part of the same attack chain.

2. Multi-Alert Correlation

Detect patterns where multiple alerts indicate a single complex attack.

Example: Brute force → Successful login → Privilege escalation → Suspicious data transfer

Document how you correlated these alerts.

3. Incident Response Simulation

Pick one complex incident from your monitoring exercise.

Investigate all related alerts and log sources.

Document:

Timeline of the attack

IP addresses and systems affected

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Suggested containment and mitigation steps

4. Traffic Analysis

Use Wireshark or Security Onion to analyze packet captures relevant to the incident.

Identify suspicious traffic (e.g., data exfiltration, C2 communication, abnormal connections).

Take screenshots for documentation.

5. Incident Report & Escalation

Write a professional incident report including:

Description of attack

Timeline and correlated alerts

IoCs and traffic evidence

Recommended escalation or containment actions

Create an escalation template suitable for L2 or IR team handoff.

6. Tools & Resources Allowed

SIEM Tools: Splunk, Wazuh, ELK, Security Onion

Traffic Analysis: Wireshark, Zeek (Security Onion)

Incident Management: TheHive, MISP, Excel / Word for documentation

Resources: MITRE ATT&CK Framework, public logs, and pcap repositories

7. Deliverables

Correlated Alert Map showing which alerts are related.

Traffic Analysis Screenshots (at least 3) with annotations.

Incident Response Report (2–3 pages).

Incident Escalation Template.

All files packaged as:

SOC-WK4-[YourName].zip

8. Evaluation Criteria

Correct multi-alert correlation demonstrating attack understanding

Accurate traffic analysis supporting findings

Clarity, completeness, and professionalism of incident report

Proper escalation documentation

Timely submission

9. Mentor Notes

Focus on understanding how multiple alerts can be part of a single attack chain.

Make your reports concise and evidence-backed, similar to what a SOC L1 would submit to senior analysts.

This week simulates real-world SOC work, preparing you for live monitoring tasks and IR workflows.
