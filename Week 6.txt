SOC Internship – Week 6 Task Ticket

Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK6-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote
Assigned Date: 15-Sep-2025
Due Date: 21-Sep-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)

Objective

Simulate a complete SOC-to-IR handoff: from alert detection, to incident triage, to containment recommendation. This week emphasizes response playbooks and forensics basics.

Task Description

Review Incident Response Lifecycle

Study NIST 800-61 IR phases: Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.

Write a 1-page summary of how SOC fits into each phase.

Playbook Creation

Build 2 incident response playbooks (flowcharts or documents):

Ransomware outbreak

Phishing email leading to credential theft

Each playbook must include:

SOC detection step

Escalation path

Containment action

IR/Recovery step

Log & Traffic Analysis – Forensics Angle

Using Security Onion / Wireshark, analyze logs & traffic for possible compromise:

Identify a phishing delivery (email logs or malicious HTTP).

Track post-compromise activity (PowerShell, data staging, lateral movement).

Take at least 3 forensic-style screenshots (logs + packets).

Containment Simulation

Pick one incident (phishing OR ransomware).

Write a containment recommendation:

Isolate system? Block IP? Reset credentials? Patch software?

Justify why that containment is effective.

Reporting & Handoff

Create a professional Incident Response Report (3–4 pages) including:

Timeline of the attack

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Root cause analysis (where detection could improve)

Containment & mitigation recommendations

Lessons learned (what SOC should adjust for future)

Tools & Resources Allowed

SIEM & Traffic: Security Onion, Wazuh, Splunk, Wireshark, Zeek

Threat Intel: VirusTotal, MISP, urlscan.io

Playbook Creation: Draw.io, Lucidchart, PowerPoint, or Word

Reference: NIST 800-61, MITRE ATT&CK for mapping

Deliverables

1-page SOC role in IR lifecycle.

2 Incident Playbooks (ransomware, phishing).

Traffic/Log screenshots (3+) showing forensic analysis.

Containment recommendation (short doc).

Incident Response Report (3–4 pages).

Packaged as:

SOC-WK6-[YourName].zip

Evaluation Criteria

Correct understanding of SOC in IR lifecycle.

Clear and realistic incident playbooks.

Accuracy in forensic-style log/traffic analysis.

Strong, justified containment recommendation.

Professional, structured IR report.

Mentor Notes

This week is a bridge between SOC and IR teams. Show that you can not only detect, but also advise on response.

Reports should be executive-readable (SOC → CISO handoff).

This is where you show maturity as a SOC analyst — not just reacting to alerts, but contributing to resilience.
