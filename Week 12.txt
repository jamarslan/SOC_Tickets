🎓 SOC Internship Graduation Challenge – Mock SOC Interview Exam

Exam ID: SOC-INT-2025-FINAL
Duration: 90–120 minutes (self-paced)
Format: Hands-on + Written (like real SOC assessments)

Part 1 – Technical Hands-On (Logs + PCAP)

You’ll be given:

A short log dataset (auth + web logs)

A pcap file snippet (simulating malicious traffic)

Your Tasks:

Identify suspicious activity in the logs (failed logins, privilege escalation, unusual access).

Analyze the pcap in Wireshark and answer:

Which protocol was used for data exfiltration?

What destination IP/domain looks suspicious?

Is there evidence of C2 beaconing?

Correlate logs + traffic → build an attack timeline.

Map the observed activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

Part 2 – Detection Engineering

Write two SIEM queries/rules that would detect the observed activity in future.

One for credential abuse/privilege escalation.

One for data exfiltration over unusual channels.

Part 3 – Incident Escalation & Reporting

Draft an incident escalation ticket as if sending to L2/IR. Include:

Incident summary (1–2 sentences)

Evidence (log lines, pcap findings, IoCs)

Impact (system/user affected)

Recommended containment action

Part 4 – Oral/Behavioral Mock Q&A

(Practice answering these out loud as if in an interview)

Walk me through how you investigate a phishing email alert.

What’s the difference between SIEM detection and threat hunting?

How do you prioritize multiple alerts during a shift?

Tell me about a time (from this internship) when you correlated multiple events into one incident.

If you don’t know how to investigate an alert, what do you do?

Mentor Notes

This is the capstone hiring simulation: hands-on detection, correlation, reporting, and communication.

If you complete this, you’ll be ready to show real-world SOC skills in interviews.

After this, we’ll shift into resume polishing + interview coaching until you land a role.
