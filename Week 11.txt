Post-Internship Phase (After Week 10)
1. Portfolio & Resume Deployment

Upload your SOC Internship Portfolio (from Weeks 1–9 projects + Week 9 capstone).

Finalize your 1-page resume with:

Tools used: Splunk, Wazuh, Wireshark, Security Onion, Zeek, Suricata, MITRE ATT&CK, MISP.

Achievements: “Built and tested 15+ SIEM rules, performed full incident response investigations, conducted red vs blue simulations.”

Post portfolio on GitHub / personal site (redact sensitive info, but showcase methodology).

2. Mock SOC Analyst Interview Prep (Advanced)

I’ll give you:

Scenario-based challenges (short log snippets / pcap traces).

Behavioral questions (teamwork, escalation, stress-handling).

Technical drill (write a Splunk/Wazuh query, explain packet captures, detect anomalies).

3. Certifications to Pursue (Optional, but Strong Boost)

Beginner-friendly SOC certs:

CompTIA Security+

Splunk Core Certified User

Wazuh/SIEM Hands-on labs (free)

Advanced:

CySA+ (Blue Team)

eJPT (Pentesting basics, if you want hybrid SOC + VAPT)

SANS SEC511 (if aiming for high-end SOC roles)

4. Job Application Strategy

Apply to:

SOC Analyst L1/L2 roles

Cybersecurity Operations internships (if you want a bridge)

Blue Team Apprentice programs

Emphasize hands-on projects in interviews — recruiters love proof of lab work.

5. Long-Term Roadmap (Beyond Internship)

First 6 months in job: focus on becoming very fast at triage & escalation.

1 year in SOC: build niche in Threat Hunting or Incident Response.

After 2+ years: choose specialization — Threat Intel, IR, Purple Team, or pivot into VAPT.

✅ From here, we can:

Start mock interviews with real log/pcap cases.

Polish your resume + LinkedIn profile.

Build a public project portfolio to attract recruiters.
