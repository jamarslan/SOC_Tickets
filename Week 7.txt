SOC Internship – Week 7 Task Ticket

Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK7-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote
Assigned Date: 22-Sep-2025
Due Date: 28-Sep-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)

Objective

Practice adversary emulation using MITRE ATT&CK techniques, then build detections and hunts against those activities in your SOC tools.

Task Description

Adversary Technique Simulation

Pick two MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

Example: T1059 – Command and Scripting (PowerShell)

Example: T1041 – Exfiltration over C2 Channel

Simulate them in a controlled lab environment (use a test Windows/Linux VM).

Document commands or tools used (only in lab).

Blue Team Detection Rules

In Wazuh / Splunk / Security Onion, create rules/queries to detect your simulated activities.

Example queries:

Suspicious PowerShell execution (EncodedCommand)

Large outbound traffic to unknown IPs (Zeek/Suricata logs)

Threat Hunting Validation

Run a manual hunt to confirm detections.

Save queries and screenshots showing detection success.

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Map both simulated techniques to MITRE Navigator.

Show coverage: which tactics you tested, which you detected.

Red vs. Blue Report

Write a 3-page report including:

Red Team actions (simulation commands & attack flow).

Blue Team actions (rules, hunts, alerts).

MITRE ATT&CK mapping layer.

Gaps in detection (what you couldn’t catch).

Recommendations for improving detection.

Tools & Resources Allowed

Red Team (Simulated Attacks): PowerShell (Windows), Bash (Linux), Metasploit (optional, lab only)

Blue Team (Defense): Wazuh, Splunk, Security Onion, Zeek, Suricata

Mapping: MITRE ATT&CK Navigator

Docs: Word, PowerPoint, or PDF for reports

Deliverables

Attack simulation documentation (commands, screenshots).

Detection rules/queries with screenshots.

MITRE ATT&CK PDF layer.

Red vs. Blue report (3 pages).

Package as:

SOC-WK7-[YourName].zip

Evaluation Criteria

Correct simulation of 2 MITRE techniques.

Working detection rules/queries.

Clear hunting validation with screenshots.

MITRE ATT&CK mapping accuracy.

Professional Red vs. Blue report.

Mentor Notes

This week builds practical detection engineering skills.

Be careful: keep attack simulation only in a safe VM lab, never on production systems.

Show that you can think like both attacker and defender.
