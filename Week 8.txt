SOC Internship – Week 8 Task Ticket

Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK8-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote (Purple-Team Exercise)
Assigned Date: 29-Sep-2025
Due Date: 05-Oct-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)

Objective

Perform a Purple Team exercise where you (or a partner/simulated script) execute selected attack techniques in a lab and you build/validate detections, block/mitigation steps, and measure detection coverage & mean time to detect (MTTD).

Task Description

Plan the Exercise

Choose 3 attack techniques (from MITRE ATT&CK) spanning Initial Access → Execution → Exfiltration.

Define success criteria for each technique (e.g., detection alert fired within X minutes, block applied).

Prepare a short attack plan (commands/tools) to run in your isolated lab VM.

Execute Attacks (Lab Only)

Run the attacks in a controlled VM environment (keep all activity offline or in lab network).

Record timestamps for: attack start, detection alert(s), mitigation action.

Detection & Response

Ensure your SIEM (Wazuh/Splunk/Security Onion) has detection rules enabled.

If a technique was undetected, create or tune a rule to detect it.

Apply an appropriate mitigation (block IP, disable account, quarantine host) and record the time of action.

Measure & Record Metrics

For each technique, record:

Whether detection occurred (Yes/No)

Time to detect (seconds/minutes) — MTTD

Time to mitigate (seconds/minutes) — MTTR (time-to-remediate)

False positives observed (if any)

Present a short table of results.

Purple-Team Report

Produce a 3-page report including:

Attack plan & MITRE ATT&CK mapping (techniques used)

Detection rules used/created (with logic)

Mitigation actions taken and rationale

Metrics table (MTTD/MTTR) and lessons learned

Prioritized recommendations to improve detection or response

Tools & Resources Allowed

Attack simulation: PowerShell, Bash scripts, or Metasploit in lab VMs (never on production).

Detection/Logging: Security Onion (Zeek/Suricata), Wazuh, Splunk, Elastic.

Packet analysis: Wireshark / Zeek logs.

Case mgmt / reporting: TheHive / MISP / Word / Excel / PDF.

Mapping: MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.

Deliverables

Attack plan doc (commands, VMs used).

PCAP(s) or logs showing activity.

Detection rules created/tuned (file or query text).

Metrics table (MTTD / MTTR per technique).

Purple-Team Report (3 pages).

Package as:

SOC-WK8-[YourName].zip

Evaluation Criteria

Appropriate and safe attack execution limited to lab VMs.

Detection coverage and effectiveness of created/tuned rules.

Clear measurement of detection & mitigation metrics.

Quality of remediation recommended & executed.

Clarity, accuracy and professionalism of final report.

Mentor Notes

Keep everything contained to lab VMs. Save logs/pcaps for verification.

Aim for one detection improvement per technique (create/tune rule).

Use this exercise to show measurable improvement — recruiters love MTTD/MTTR numbers.
