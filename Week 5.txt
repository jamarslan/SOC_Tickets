SOC Internship – Week 5 Task Ticket

Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK5-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote
Assigned Date: 08-Sep-2025
Due Date: 14-Sep-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)

Objective

Enhance SOC capabilities by practicing threat hunting, integrating threat intelligence (TI) feeds, and applying IoCs into your SOC platform for proactive detection.

Task Description

Threat Hunting Basics

Research and define the difference between detection vs. hunting.

Create a checklist of threat hunting hypotheses (e.g., abnormal login times, beaconing traffic, suspicious PowerShell commands).

Hunt in Logs & Traffic

Use your SIEM (Wazuh / Splunk / Security Onion) to run manual hunts:

Search for abnormal login behavior (e.g., multiple logins from foreign IPs).

Look for repeated beaconing (same interval connections).

Identify suspicious process execution (Sysmon logs if available).

Save queries and screenshots.

Threat Intelligence Integration

Use one open-source TI platform:

MISP (preferred)

Or external APIs like VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, urlscan.io

Collect at least 5 IoCs (IP, domain, hash, or URL).

Cross-check those IoCs in your SIEM logs to see if they appear in your environment.

MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Map at least 2 techniques from your hunting exercise to MITRE ATT&CK (example: PowerShell execution → Execution tactic).

Export layer as PDF.

Threat Hunting Report

Write a 3–4 page report including:

Hunting hypotheses and methods used.

Queries and findings with screenshots.

IoCs collected + enrichment details.

MITRE mapping of observed techniques.

Recommendations for detection improvements.

Tools & Resources Allowed

SIEM Tools: Splunk, Wazuh, Elastic, Security Onion

Threat Intel: MISP, VirusTotal, urlscan.io, AbuseIPDB

Traffic/Logs: Wireshark, Zeek logs, Sysmon logs

MITRE ATT&CK Navigator for mapping

Deliverables

Threat Hunting Queries (saved in PDF/Word).

Screenshots of hunts in SIEM/logs.

List of IoCs (with enrichment details from TI tools).

MITRE ATT&CK layer PDF.

Threat Hunting Report (3–4 pages).

Packaged as:

SOC-WK5-[YourName].zip

Evaluation Criteria

Clarity in explaining hypotheses vs. detection.

Correctness and creativity in hunting queries.

Successful IoC integration and enrichment.

Proper MITRE mapping of at least 2 techniques.

Quality and professionalism of final hunting report.

Mentor Notes

Think like an attacker hiding in logs. Don’t wait for alerts — go hunt for anomalies.

Show how TI feeds make hunting stronger (turn unknown IP → malicious IP with context).

Document both successful and unsuccessful hunts (real analysts often get “no hits”).
