SOC Internship – Week 9 Task Ticket

Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK9-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote (Capstone Project)
Assigned Date: 06-Oct-2025
Due Date: 12-Oct-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)

Objective

Simulate a complete end-to-end attack investigation: from initial compromise through escalation to data exfiltration, applying SOC skills across monitoring, detection, hunting, escalation, and reporting.

Task Description

Attack Scenario Design

Define an attack chain using at least 4 MITRE ATT&CK techniques spanning different tactics.

Example chain: Phishing (Initial Access) → Credential Dumping (Credential Access) → Privilege Escalation → Exfiltration Over HTTP.

Document your attack path plan before simulation.

Simulate Attack in Lab

Execute your chosen chain in a controlled VM setup.

Record activity timestamps (each step of attack).

Capture logs/traffic (Wireshark, Zeek, Wazuh, Suricata).

Detection & Hunting

Use your SIEM (Splunk / Wazuh / Security Onion) to detect suspicious activity.

Create at least 3 custom detection rules/queries aligned with your attack techniques.

Perform threat hunting queries to uncover hidden activity.

Take screenshots of detections and queries.

Incident Response Simulation

Build an incident timeline from compromise → escalation → exfiltration.

Identify IoCs (IPs, domains, hashes, commands).

Recommend containment actions at each stage (e.g., block IP, disable account).

Simulate escalation to L2/IR team with proper ticket documentation.

Capstone Report

Write a 5–6 page professional report including:

Attack chain design (with MITRE ATT&CK mapping)

Detection methods and custom rules created

Hunting queries and findings

Incident timeline & IoCs

Recommended containment & recovery

Lessons learned & improvements for SOC

Tools & Resources Allowed

Attack simulation: PowerShell, Bash, Metasploit, Atomic Red Team (safe, lab only).

Detection/Monitoring: Wazuh, Splunk, Security Onion, Elastic.

Traffic Analysis: Wireshark, Zeek, Suricata.

Case Mgmt & TI: TheHive, MISP, VirusTotal.

Mapping: MITRE ATT&CK Navigator.

Deliverables

Attack path plan document.

PCAPs / logs from simulation.

3+ custom detection rules/queries.

Screenshots of detections & hunts.

Capstone Report (5–6 pages).

All packaged as:

SOC-WK9-[YourName].zip

Evaluation Criteria

Creativity & completeness of attack chain.

Accuracy and effectiveness of detection rules.

Depth of hunting queries and IoC collection.

Quality of incident timeline & escalation.

Professionalism and clarity of capstone report.

Mentor Notes

This week simulates real SOC work under attack — treat it like a real incident investigation.

Reports should be executive-friendly, as if you’re presenting to SOC Manager / CISO.

This is your portfolio piece to showcase in interviews — proof you can handle SOC workflow end-to-end.
