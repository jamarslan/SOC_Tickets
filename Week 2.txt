SOC Internship – Week 2 Task Ticket

Ticket ID: SOC-INT-2025-WK2-001
Role: SOC Analyst Intern – Remote
Assigned Date: 18-Aug-2025
Due Date: 24-Aug-2025
Reviewer: SOC Lead (Mentor)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective

Learn to build and fine-tune detection rules for common attack techniques using a SIEM tool (Splunk/Wazuh/Elastic). Understand how to correlate logs and detect abnormal activity based on attack patterns.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task Description
1. Review MITRE ATT&CK Techniques
Research two new techniques:
Initial Access (e.g., Phishing, Exploit Public-Facing App).
Persistence (e.g., Web Shell, Scheduled Task).
Create a simple MITRE ATT&CK mapping for both techniques.
2. SIEM Rule Creation
Install or use a SIEM tool (e.g., Wazuh or Splunk).
Based on your MITRE research, create at least two detection rules:
One rule for Initial Access (e.g., Phishing).
One rule for Persistence (e.g., Scheduled Task).
For each rule, specify the log sources (e.g., authentication logs, HTTP logs, sysmon), conditions, and alerts.
Test these rules using sample logs (you can use open-source logs or Security Onion if needed).
3. Traffic Analysis & Correlation
Analyze the traffic captured from Wireshark or use a new malicious pcap sample.
Correlate the events to identify any signs of persistence or initial access based on your MITRE mapping.
Take screenshots of your findings from Wireshark or other traffic analysis tools.

4. Documentation & Reporting
Document the SIEM rules created and justifications for each.
Explain how these rules correlate with the MITRE techniques and why they are effective for SOC use cases.
Submit a 2-page report combining:
MITRE ATT&CK mappings (for both techniques).
SIEM rules with explanations.
Traffic analysis findings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools & Resources Allowed

SIEM tools: Splunk, Wazuh, Elastic (or any other preferred SIEM tool).

Traffic Analysis: Wireshark, Security Onion, or any malicious pcap.

Resources: MITRE ATT&CK Framework, open-source logs, public pcap repositories.
